jquery-externalify
==================

Plugin to tag external urls as rel=external. 

# What?

All external urls are marked with a rel="external" attribute.

# Why?

You can write your code with usual <a href="http://google.com"> etc, and the plugin will apply this atribute to correct links. (For example for styling external links differently.)
    
# Usage

$("body").externalify()
